# Encryption-Decryption-using-Distilled-Order-Hyper-Chaotic-Algorithm
The algorithm is based on chaos theory. This chaotic behavior will be
implemented through feedback loop, iterative repetitions and orderly patterns.
● Three Aspects to Research on Chaotic Image encryption :
1. Encryption (Symmetric, Stream)
2. Image(3D,Coloured)
3. Chaotic factor (Domains : Spatio Temporal, Dimensions)
● We plan to convert the 3D image into a 2D space by streams from its RGB values.
● We propose a purely software based approach where we implement a diffusion
function using XOR after scrambling of images to achieve chaos as opposed to the
hardware intensive alternatives like Chua circuits, Memristive circuits or optical
chaos using lasers.
● The fractional chaotic system show higher non linearity and a greater degree of
freedom due to fractional derivatives as compared to an integer chaotic system
and the hyper chaotic attractors show a higher degree of randomness
