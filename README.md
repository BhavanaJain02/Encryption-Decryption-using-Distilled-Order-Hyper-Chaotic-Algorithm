# Encryption-Decryption-using-Distilled-Order-Hyper-Chaotic-Algorithm



The Distilled Order Hyperchaotic algorithm is a robust encryption technique used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. 
The algorithm is based on chaos theory. This chaotic behavior will be
implemented through feedback loop, iterative repetitions and orderly patterns.
Encryption involves the process of converting plain, readable information into an encoded format that can only be understood by authorized parties. 
Decryption, on the other hand, is the reverse process of converting the encrypted data back into its original, readable form.

Three Aspects to Research on Chaotic Image encryption :

1. Encryption (Symmetric, Stream)
2. Image(3D,Coloured)
3. Chaotic factor (Domains : Spatio Temporal, Dimensions)
   ● We plan to convert the 3D image into a 2D space by streams from its RGB values.
   ● We propose a purely software based approach where we implement a diffusion function using XOR after scrambling of images to achieve chaos as opposed to the hardware intensive alternatives like Chua circuits, Memristive circuits or optical chaos using lasers.
   ● The fractional chaotic system show higher non linearity and a greater degree of freedom due to fractional derivatives as compared to an integer chaotic system and the hyper chaotic attractors show a higher degree of       randomness
   
   
**How Encryption Works**

The encryption process using the Distilled Order Hyperchaotic algorithm involves converting plain, readable information into an encoded format, ensuring its confidentiality and security. The algorithm relies on the principles of chaos theory to generate a sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which are used to scramble the data effectively.

1. Secret Key Generation: A secret key is required to initialize the chaotic system. The secret key serves as the initial parameter to generate the sequence of pseudo-random numbers.
2. Plaintext and Random Numbers Combination: The plaintext data is combined with the pseudo-random numbers using a series of mathematical operations. This process results in ciphertext that appears random and unintelligible.
3. Confidential Transmission: The encrypted ciphertext can be safely transmitted over insecure networks or stored, ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of the information.


**How Decryption Works**

The decryption process using the Distilled Order Hyperchaotic algorithm involves converting the encrypted data back into its original, readable form. Decryption can only be performed with the correct secret key, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information.

1. Secret Key Retrieval: The correct secret key used during the encryption process is required to initiate the decryption process. Without the correct key, decrypting the data becomes practically infeasible.
2. Ciphertext and Random Numbers Reversal: The ciphertext is processed in reverse, applying mathematical operations that undo the transformations performed during encryption. This process reconstructs the original plaintext data.
3. Confidentiality Restoration: The decrypted plaintext data can now be accessed, enabling authorized parties to retrieve and utilize the original information.


**Benefits and Applications**

The Distilled Order Hyperchaotic algorithm offers numerous advantages for data security:

1. High Security: By leveraging chaos theory, the algorithm provides a strong resistance against cryptanalysis and brute-force attacks.
2. Efficiency: The encryption and decryption processes are designed to be computationally efficient, ensuring secure data handling without significant performance degradation.
3. Versatility: The algorithm can be applied to various data types, including text, files, and multimedia, making it suitable for diverse applications and industries.
4. Secure Communication: The algorithm can be used to secure data transmission over insecure networks, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted information.
